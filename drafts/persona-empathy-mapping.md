Persona Empathy Mapping is a workshop activity that builds empathy, gains alignment around user needs, goals, and pain-points, and bridges the gap between personas and design concepts.


It reveals the underlying “why” behind users’ actions, choices and decisions so we can proactively design for their real needs - those that are difficult for users’ to perceive and articulate.
It sticks. It invites others to internalize parts of the users’ experience in ways that listening to or reading a report cannot.
It paves the way for innovative design concepts to be revealed. Now that the stakeholders understand the user’s situations, they are able to quickly understand how slight design changes can make a big impact on users.
