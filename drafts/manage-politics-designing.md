Shipping great design work is a struggle. You can have expert knowledge of
Photoshop, color theory, copywriting, grid systems and branding, and however
ship crap products.

It's good for the designers developing soft skills like working with a team,
and building credibility.

KNOW YOUR OWN TEAM

Identify decision-makers
------------------------

Stakeholders, or in small teams the complany's founders.

Identify conciously these people and get to know them.


Speak their dialect
-------------------

Explain your recommendations so decision-makers can understand you.
Not use subjective speach. Instead of "it looks better", say
"this reinforces the brand".


Feel their pain
---------------

Consider what pressures your decision-makers face. These pressures
compromises a lot your work. Think about them, and if you can't defend
your decisions against them, consider whether they are really the 
right decisions.


BUILD CREDIBILITY

Bring the data
--------------

Use stats, real users tests, anything that helps you to make confidently
recommendations.

After the launch, measure the success of your design.


Shut up and design
------------------

Bridge the gap between concept and reality. Sketch something in paper or
in your laptop, when people are debating the approach. Put yourself at
the center of the debate.


Prepare
-------

The biggest struggles usually occur at the end of the projects. That's why
so important to work with your team early on. Engage everybody.


Be friendly
-----------

Soft skill. Try to be friendly with your entire team. Relationships take
work.


Get a seat at the table from the beginning
------------------------------------------

Become as someone with valuable insights and suggestiones.


Become known as a tinkerer
--------------------------

Come up with your own ideas and express them through design.
