Well then, as now, the meaning of design to a software developer was different than the meaning for, say, an auto developer, interior designer, or someone making pharmaceuticals. To understand this difference you have to tease the concept of design apart. Most people tend to think of design as an aesthetic exercise, to make something pretty, pleasant, nice, like Martha Stewart. Understanding design in the context of function was and is a different matter; and much of my early thinking around Goal-Directed Design hinged on this.

Well, this is a conception of design that isn’t Martha Stewart. This isn’t about what looks good, or what you like, or what comes out of your “artistic well,” it’s about what solves a problem in the real world. And it’s a completely different vision of design.

 I realized that when your approach is to simply create functionality to bestow on the masses, it doesn’t come through, it doesn’t work, and it doesn’t satisfy.

It’s one thing to say you’ve got to make a product easy to use, and another to say just exactly how you do that

And the answer, it turns out, is not really an engineering problem. And since most other problems in the software business are engineering problems, the industry is populated with talented engineers who, not surprisingly, try to solve each problem by engineering. But it’s not an engineering problem.

And top of the list was getting into the user’s head. That was just fundamental.

So the essential revelation came to me that what mattered isn’t just knowing what people have to do, but answering, “what is their desired end state?” Where do they want to go? 

And I began to see this in terms of their goals and their motivations, breaking down the problem in order to understand it so that you can design the software to satisfy it. So it isn’t looking at what people do, but why they do it. 

EXAMPLE
 Say the person you’re designing for wants to spend Christmas with grandma. She assumes a requirement is driving, and thus needs to pack the car, stop at the gas station, and put chains on the tires. So if you start building software to pack the car, put gas in the car and put chains on the tires that’s how you make bad software. 
acking and filling gas tanks isn’t what she wants to do, she wants to touch a picture of grandma on a screen, and boom, magically appear at grandma’s house. That’s what the persona you’re designing for wants.
 Otherwise the actions and functions will be very rational and engineering-centric, and that’s what engineering approach gets you to, the sum of all desired functionality.

And if you understand social media, you see that it mirrors this. Social media is essentially about either finding dates or bragging to your peers. And with this realization all of the sudden you get what it really is

So the key is not about the aesthetics, and it’s not about the blocking and tackling of screen design, buttons and functions, it about how do you understand what problem it is you are working on?

And the most critical part of problem solving is knowing which problem it is you are solving. And what the Goal-Directed Design process does is provide a problem knowing process – what problem are you solving and what are the salient parts of the problem? What is really critical?


PROCESS

Basically you find one person, understand their vision and their final desired end state, and then make them ecstatically happy about reaching their end state.

And what you need are two things: 1) Find (or synthesize) the right person and 2) Design for that person.

For us at Cooper, a team of trained designers needs to synthesize the representative user, called a persona.

And when your persona’s needs are satisfied in multiple scenarios, you know you are on the right track.

Designers at Cooper can go into healthcare, tech, or jet engine design, wrap their head around it and articulate the representative user’s desired end state, and from there identify the right problem to solve. Then synthesizing form just becomes the work, not magic at that point.

But Apple knows that saving money doesn’t lead to success, making their customers ecstatically happy leads to success. And of course success leads to money.
