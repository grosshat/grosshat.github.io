User Experience Design tries to ensure that no aspect of the user's experience
with the product happens without your conscious, explicit intent.

	-> Why is that link there?
	-> What for is that menu?
	-> Why is there a gallery of pics?
	-> etc.


That abstract idea is difficult to manage as a whole. It is easier to divide
it into its different parts.

	1. Strategy
	2. Scope
	3. Structure
	4. Skeleton
	5. Surface

These are the 5s, and they are related one to each other. So, no decision can
be made in one part without touching the other ones. They must be aligned.

	strategy ------ scope ------- structure ------- skeleton ------- surface

That alignment means constraints, but at the same time it gives us a good
way of measuring whether the products follows the line or not.

That alignment means also that decisions on each part implies that we have to
think how they affect to the others.

Strategy
=======

	A. User Needs: 	goals of the site from outside our organization. Audience.
			People using product, and people who will use it.

		-> who they are
		-> what they need
		-> actual customers
		-> user segmentation (age, gender, technology-attitude, knowledge...)
		-> user research: surveys, interviews, focus groups
		-> personas


	B. Product Objetctives: make money. Give information. Build a network of
				fans...

		-> explicit
		-> brand identity (graphic but also as the result of interactions with the product)
		-> success metrics: how will be measured when the goals are achieved
			(get new visitors, get more time on the web, get more money...?)



Scope
=====

	A. Functional specifications: feature set of the product.


		-> reduces ambiguity
		-> gives common goals for the entire team
		-> requirements
		-> schedule, milestones
		-> avoid "telÃ©fono estropeado"
		-> what you are building, and what you are NOT building
		-> avoid scope creep: snowball
		-> software development

	B. Content requirements: content elements that will be required.


Global Requirements: browsers, devices
Concrete Requirements: features related, group brainstorming, opening the minds, using personas
for thinking that features on scenarios, competitors.

	-> be positive, describing the feature
	-> be specific
	-> avoid subjective language, because subjective matter without relation to the person who
	likes/or not is not measurable

It is very important that the scope can be MEASURED, ie. if the goals have been achieved or not.

In content requirements it is needed to have an idea of the dimensions of the things: big pics
or thumbnails, big descriptions or brief texts, etc. And WHO is RESPONSIBLE. CONTENT IS HARD WORK.
CONTENT, EFFECTIVE CONTENT, REQUIRES CONSTANT MAINTENANCE. So you have to get an idea of the
frequency of the updades, how and who.

Structure
=========

	A. Interaction Design: how the system behaves in response to the user.

	B. Information Architecture: arrangement of content elements.



Skeleton
========
			
	A. Interface design
	B. Information design
	C. Navigation design


Surface
=======

	A. Sensory Experience



2 factors are predominant: CONTENT, TECHNOLOGY.
