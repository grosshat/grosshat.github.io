Before the sprint: Prepare
==========================

Get the people and things you need.


Day 1: Understand
=================

Dig into the design problem through research, competitive review, and strategy exercises.

Day 2: Diverge
==============

Rapidly develop as many solutions as possible.

Day 3: Decide
=============

Choose the best ideas and hammer out a user story.

Day 4: Prototype
================

Build something quick and dirty that can be shown to users.

Day 5: Validate
===============

Show the prototype to real humans (in other words, people outside your company) and learn what works and what doesnâ€™t work.

The magic of constraints
------------------------

There was something magical about a tight time constraint combined with individual work, prototyping, and quick user feedback.


I ditched polished Photoshop mockups in favor of quick-and-dirty Keynote prototypes.
