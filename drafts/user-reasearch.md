It’s the best way to test assumptions without the time or expense of launching. It reduces risk and helps your team work more quickly and more confidently.


Research makes great design possible
====================================

At Google Ventures, we use design sprints to invent and prototype ideas. Research sprints are an essential part of this process — it’s how we test our ideas without the time or expense of launching.


 Instead of launching something that might not work, you’ll have confidence in the solution you’ve refined through research.

Then you can invest the time to build and launch your product or feature the right way. It’ll reduce risk and save time in the long run.


 But research sprints can help you answer some of the toughest, most important questions that startups face:

What problems, needs, and motivations do people have?
How do people evaluate and adopt products?
Do people understand your product’s value proposition?
Which messages are most effective at explaining your product?
Can people figure out how to use your product?
Why do people stop using your product?
Why don’t people adopt new features when you launch them?


Components of a research sprint
===============================

1. A set of questions and assumptions. Without these, you’re not making the most of your effort. Before starting the sprint, everyone on the team should agree on the questions you plan to answer and the assumptions you plan to test.


2. Intentional and selective recruiting. You’ll need to carefully recruit people based on your goals: existing customers, prospective customers, representative customers, etc. In other words: Unless you’re building a product for Starbucks customers, you shouldn’t randomly conduct interviews with people at Starbucks.

3. A realistic prototype you can test. You can learn a lot by listening to people, but you can learn way more by seeing how they react to a realistic prototype. The more realistic, the better — you want people’s real reactions to what you’re building, not their abstract thoughts or smart-sounding feedback. (Check out some real prototypes we built in one day each.)


4. Five 1-on-1 interviews combining broad discovery questions with task-based evaluation of a prototype. 1-on-1 interviews (in person or remotely) are the best-bang-for-your-buck type of qualitative research. You’ll learn from facial expressions, gut reactions, and body language. You can ask follow-up questions and follow interesting tangents. Why five? It’s easy to spot patterns, and you can do five 60-minute interviews in one day. (Plus, Jakob Nielsen approves.) We’ll help you write an interview guide that keeps you on track during the interviews.


5. Real-time summarization of findings. One thing that slows down many forms of research is the analysis — it can take days or weeks to extract findings from the data. In a research sprint, the entire team watches the interviews, takes notes, summarizes the findings, and decides on next steps before heading home for the day.


The four days
=============

As promised, a research sprint takes just four days. Here’s what we do on each day:

Day 1 (~4 hours)

Create a recruiting screener.
Post recruiting screener where the right people will see it.
Day 2 (~4 hours)

Select and schedule participants.
Start creating interview guide.
Day 3 (~4 hours)

Confirm participants.
Complete interview guide.
Review prototype with your team.
Day 4 (~8 hours)

Set up test devices and recording system.
Interview five customers!
Summarize findings and plan next steps with your team.
