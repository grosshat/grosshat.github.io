However, this approach can lead to trouble when employees begin to jump to solutions before truly understanding their customer’s problems.

horoughly defining your user’s goals can feel like a step backwards; why think about the problem when you’ve already got the solution?

Designing for a goal rather than a task enabled us to think about our app in a whole new way and start down the road towards a much more powerful product.

Creating great products requires more than just talking to your users (though that is a big part!). Rather, talking to your users is just part of a larger process of understanding your users true goals.

The transition from designing for your users tasks to designing for your users goals is one that takes a bit more work, patience, and rigorous application of proven design principles — no cutting corners!
