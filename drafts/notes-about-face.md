More and more products have software in them.

The average computer pro-
grammer and the average assembly line worker are qualitatively different in their
aptitude, attitude, training, language, tools, and value systems

The most effective
ways of supervising, tracking, and managing programmers are dramatically differ-
ent from those used so successfully with blue-collar workers of an earlier age. Get-
ting programmers to do what is best for the company requires skills unknown to
the industrial-age executive.

Once a software program has been successfully written, it can be reproduced an
unlimited number of times for virtually nothing. There is little benefit in reducing
the cost of writing it. Reducing the amount one spends on software construction
usually means compromising the quality, so the primary business equation of the
industrial age is reversed today.

The best and brightest minds of today apply them-
selves to increasing the effectiveness of software and the quality of its behavior.

It’s no wonder that companies struggle with software. Very capable executives find
that their intentions are subtly but significantly altered somewhere along the path
from conception to release.

It’s time to let go of
obsolete industrial-age management methods and adopt interaction design as the
primary tool for designing and managing software construction.

Dominated for so long by simple ex post facto,
trial-and-error methods, interaction design—along with its many siblings and
variants—has matured into a clear, dependable, effective tool for determining what
behavior will succeed.

Interaction design has also shown its power as a marketing tool, communicating
with great clarity and specificity about exactly whom will be using the product and
why. Getting to the root of customer motivations is manna for marketers, and the
qualitative research and analysis aspects of Goal-Directed Design provide signifi-
cant market insight.


At my company, Cooper,
clients bring our designers into the complex worlds of finance, health care, phar-
maceuticals, human resources, programming tools, museums, consumer credit,
and any number of disparate fields. Our teams, none of whom have any training
in—or typically even any exposure to—the particular subject matter at hand, rou-
tinely become sufficiently expert in only a few weeks to astonish our clients. We can
do this because our point of departure is relentlessly human-centered, rather than
technology-centered.

Interaction design is a tool for “Knowing what the user wants.”
Armed with that
knowledge, you can create better, more successful, bit-empowered products, and
you can sell them for more money. What’s more, you will reach your market with a
loyalty-inducing, better solution.

Design of Behavior, and Design of Form
======================================
This book is about interaction design—the practice of designing interactive digi-
tal products, environments, systems, and services. Like many design disciplines,
interaction design is concerned with form. However, first and foremost, interaction
design focuses on something that traditional design disciplines do not often
explore: the design of behavior.

Complex Behavior
================
Products with sofwate exhibit a complex behavior: a traditional oven was quite
simple and predictable. Just one position or another. A modern oven implies
buttons, states and dependencies, that transforms that product in one quite
complex.

And to be clear—it is very much a design discipline, quite different from science and engineering. 
While it should always be
practiced in a rational and considered manner, interaction design is about synthe-
sis and imagining things as they might be, not necessarily as they currently are.

Interaction design is also an inherently humanistic enterprise. It is concerned most
significantly with satisfying the needs and desires of the people who will interact
with a product or service.

GOAL DIRECTED DESIGN
====================

We’ve found that when a
designer focuses on people’s goals—the reasons why they use a product in the first
place—as well as their expectations, attitudes, and aptitudes, they can devise solu-
tions that people find powerful and pleasurable.

Holistic Perspective
====================
Even a relatively simple product must be considered in totality and in light
of its context in the world. Again, we’ve found that a methodical approach helps
provide the holistic perspective necessary to create products that people find useful
and engaging.

History
=======
In the late 1970s and early 1980s a dedicated and visionary set of researchers, engi-
neers, and designers in the San Francisco Bay Area were busy inventing how people
would interact with computers in the future. At Xerox Parc, SRI, and eventually
Apple Computer, people had begun discussing what it meant to create useful and
usable “human interfaces” to digital products. In the mid-1980s, two industrial
designers, Bill Moggridge and Bill Verplank, who were working on the first laptop
computer, the GRiD Compass, coined the term interaction design for what they
were doing, but it would be another 10 years before other designers rediscovered
this term and brought it into mainstream use.

People are
tired of new technology for its own sake. Consumers are sending a clear message
that what they want is good technology: technology that has been designed to pro-
vide a compelling and effective user experience.

n the world of digital technology, form, function, content, and behavior
are so inextricably linked that many of the challenges of designing an interactive
product go right to the heart of what a digital product is and what it does.

Tradicional design disciplines
==============================
As we’ve discussed, interaction designers have borrowed practices from more
established design disciplines, but have also evolved beyond them. Industrial
designers have attempted to address the design of digital products, but like their
counterparts in graphic design, their focus has traditionally been on the design of
static form, not the design of interactivity, or form that changes and reacts to input
over time. These disciplines do not have a language with which to discuss the design
of rich, dynamic behavior and changing user interfaces.

Extending this thinking to the world of digital products, we find it useful to think
that we influence people’s experiences by designing the mechanisms for interacting
with a product. Therefore, we have chosen Moggridge’s term, interaction design
(now abbreviated by many in the industry as IxD), to denote the kind of design this
book describes.


FORM: industrial designers, graphic designers
CONTENT: information architects, copywriters, animations, sound designers
BEHAVIOR: interaction designers

How interaction design should fit within an organization.

We
believe that establishing a rigorous product development process that incorporates
design as an equal partner with engineering, marketing, and business management,
and that includes well-defined responsibilities and authority for each group, greatly
increases the value a business can reap from design.

Design Team
===========
The design team has responsibility for users’ satisfaction with the product. Many
organizations do not currently hold anyone responsible for this. To carry out this
responsibility, designers must have the authority to decide how the product will
look, feel, and behave. They also need access to information: They must observe
and speak to potential users about their needs, to engineers about technologi-
cal opportunities and constraints, to marketing about opportunities and require-
ments, and to management about the kind of product to which the organization
will commit.

Engineering Team
================
The engineering team has responsibility for the implementation and fabrication
of the product. For the design to deliver its benefit, engineering must have the
responsibility for building, as specified, the form and behaviors that the designers
define, while keeping on budget and on schedule. Engineers, therefore, require a
clear description of the product’s form and behaviors, which will guide what they
build and drive their time and cost estimates. This description must come from
the design team. Engineers must also contribute to discussions of technical con-
straints and opportunities, as well as the feasibility of proposed design solutions.

Marketing Team
==============
The marketing team has responsibility for convincing customers to purchase the
product, so they must have authority over all communications with the customer,
as well as input into the product definition and design. In order to do this, the
team members need access to information, including the results of designers’
research, as well as research of their own. (It’s worth noting that, as we discuss
further in Chapters 4 and 5, customers and users are often different people with
different needs.)

Management Team
===============
Management has responsibility for the profitability of the resulting product, and
therefore has the authority to make decisions about what the other groups will
work on. To make those decisions, management needs to receive clear informa-
tion from the other groups: design’s research and product definition, marketing’s
research and sales projections, and engineering’s estimations of the time and
cost to create the product.


Design Principles
=================

Design
principles encompass broad ideas about the practice of design, as well as rules and
hints about how to best use specific user interface and interaction design idioms.

Design Patterns
===============
Design patterns describe sets of interaction design idioms that are common ways to
address specific user requirements and design concerns.

Design Processes
================
Design processes describe
how to go about understanding and defining user requirements, how to then trans-
late those requirements into the framework of a design, and finally how to best
apply design principles and patterns to specific contexts.

Context
=======
There is no such thing as an objectively
good user interface—quality depends on the context: who the user is, what she is
doing, and what her motivations are. Applying a set of one-size-fits-all principles
makes user interface creation easier, but it doesn’t necessarily make the end result
better.

If you want to create good design solutions, there is no avoiding the hard
work of really understanding the people who will actually interact with your prod-
uct. Only then is it useful to have at your command a toolbox of principles and pat-
terns to apply in specific situations.


We discuss four main steps to designing interactive systems in this book: research-
ing the domain, understanding the users and their requirements, defining the
framework of a solution, and filling in the design details. Many practitioners would
add a fifth step: validation, testing the effectiveness of a solution with users. This is
part of a discipline widely known as usability.


GOAL-DIRECTED DESIGN
====================

If we design and construct products in such a way
that the people who use them achieve their goals, these people will be satisfied,
effective, and happy and will gladly pay for the products and recommend that oth-
ers do the same

Why something so evident is not made this way
=============================================
Most digital products today emerge from the development process like a creature
emerging from a bubbling tank. Developers, instead of planning and executing
with a mind towards satisfying the needs of the people who purchase and use their
products, end up creating technologically focused solutions that are difficult to use
and control. Like mad scientists, they fail because they have not imbued their cre-
ations with humanity.


KEYS
====

Understanding users’ desires, needs, motivations, and contexts

Understanding business, technical, and domain opportunities, requirements, and
constraints

Using this knowledge as a foundation for plans to create products whose form,
content, and behavior is useful, usable, and desirable, as well as economically
viable and technically feasible

When performed using the appropriate methods, design can provide the missing
human connection in technological products.


Marketers vs Developers
=======================

Digital products come into this world subject to the push and pull of two, often
opposing, forces — developers and marketers. While marketers are adept at under-
standing and quantifying a marketplace opportunity, and at introducing and posi-
tioning a product within that market, their input into the product design process is
often limited to lists of requirements.

These requirements often have little to do
with what users actually need or desire and have more to do with chasing the com-
petition, managing IT resources with to-do lists, and making guesses based on mar-
ket surveys — what people say they’ll buy.

Developers, on the other hand, often have no shortage of input into the product’s
final form and behavior. Because they are in charge of construction, they decide
exactly what gets built. And they, too, have a different set of imperatives than the
product’s eventual users. Good developers are focused on solving challenging tech-
nical problems, following good engineering practices, and meeting deadlines. They
are often given incomplete, confusing, and sometimes contradictory instructions
and are forced to make significant decisions about the user experience with little
time or background.
