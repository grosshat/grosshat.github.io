Ways to cut corners, save time, and be more efficient when doing research

Start at the end: What questions do you want to answer?
-------------------------------------------------------

When you know which answers you’re after, it’s quicker to choose the most efficient way to find them — by picking an appropriate research method (survey, A/B test, literature review, usability interviews, site visits, etc.), and the right segment of customers to study.

Get feedback from customers early and often
-------------------------------------------

Check whether someone else has already done your research for you
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Don’t read the (whole) book
---------------------------

For many business books, you can get the main points without reading the whole book.

Make re-usable templates
------------------------

Create (and use!) good checklists
---------------------------------

Assemble your kit (and keep your bag packed)
--------------------------------------------

Compress interviews into one day
--------------------------------
