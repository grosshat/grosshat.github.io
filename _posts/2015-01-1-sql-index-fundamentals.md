Web Development means a lot of use of SQL, even in the time of the NoSQL Hype.
A great amount of code running under the hood is always talking to some kind
of database. As usual, the more you use something, the more you ignore how it
really works. That lack of knowledge results sometimes in wrong data management
and performance issues. Since programming and software design relies on
data structures, for performing code structures over them, the more you understand
database structures and its internal operations, the best you design your code.
