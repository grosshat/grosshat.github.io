Writing code is not an impersonal activity. On the contrary it has a close
connection with feelings, taste and personal ideas. That means there is not just
a way of doing things in programming, and those personal framework is at the end
the origin of main software development decisions. I have tried to summarize
those ones I personally like.

Choose the right and simple data structures
-------------------------------------------
When doing software development programming is often understood as the main
activity. Much of the debates about programming Languages are the result of that
prejudice. It is not only an utter waste of time, but so much the worse a wrong
perspective: it puts the focus on code structures (algorithms, code flows, etc.)
instead of data structures.
structures.

Data structures, not code structures, are central to programming. Once choosen
the right and simple ones, everything almost always becomes self-evident. Data
structures must be choosen taking into account not only the space and time
complexity of the data type, but also the operations performen upon it.
