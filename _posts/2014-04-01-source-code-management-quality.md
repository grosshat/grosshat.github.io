When you write code, in a team or just as a single developer, you get a lot of
benefits using a Source Code Management (aka Version Control) tool. 
When you start to use it, you don't even know how you survived before. Version
Control System (VCS) records changes to file/s over time so that you can recall 
specific versions later. It helps a lot giving you an structured way for
managing changes, naming them, tagging them and sharing them with other
developers. Despite its importance, there is often a lack of taste for VCS
management among developers.
