A painter knows well how the surface works, paper, canvas, copper o whatever.
A plumber understands how a toilet tank expels the water. A film director has 
some kind of knowledge about the internal operations running when the movie 
camera starts to display motion picture film by projecting it onto a screen.
Web developer is related to web browser in a similar form, but often there
is a **deep lack of knowledge about web browser's nature**: how it is built,
how it works, how it is used. The more you know about this, the best you
design your code.
