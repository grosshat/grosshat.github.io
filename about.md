Engineer. Working at Muro.exe, Mirai, Grosshat.

I'm a full-stack software developer who loves building products, doing
anything for achieving that, doing a bit of everything.

I tend to build cross-functional teams, with a lot of communication and
collaboration. Teams where personal attitudes matter. Teams with clear
vision, common goals and strong leadership.
